## Scenarios

### Remix Scenario 1: Human Invitation
Queen Zu has lured guests from across the galaxy to her Party UFO with the promise of a very special star guest: a hoo-man from Eee-arth. Now she just needs to make sure those meddling Campanella kids don't sabotage her hyperdrive before she can abduct Amy.

### Remix Scenario 2: Campaign Finance
Mayor Speck is running for re-election on a populist platform. He vehemently denies rumors that he is bankrolling his campaign with stolen money, shipping in voters from Mortolia, or forging an unholy alliance with the Demon Princess Charkas.

### Remix Scenario 3: Unholy Night
As night falls on Diskonia, red eyes shine in the darkness and the screams of the innocent are cut short by writhing tentacles from the abyss. You seek refuge in an abandoned house, but wait... what was that sound?
